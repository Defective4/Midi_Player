# Midi_Player

My *very first* project in Java.  
**Midi_Player** was created back in 2019, when I first ventured into Java world.

> This project was written in [Geany](https://www.geany.org/)  
> and originally wasn't using Maven.  
> Additionally I reformatted all source code files, but the code is otherwise left untouched.
